Twitch TV API

FreeCodeCamp.com : Advanced Front End Development Projects
Uses Twitch.tv API and meets the following user needs:

User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
